<H3>Theoretical Seismogram Calculation</H3>

The calculation of the seismic response of a horizontally layered
elastic medium to a buried seismic source is carried out by building up the
response in the slowness-frequency domain.
<P>
All the internal calculations are carried out in memory for a
single seismic component at a time:
In the Fortran program erzsol3 - the complex arrays 
RU(5,2500,600), RV(5,2500,600), RW(5,2500,600)
are dimensioned to allow:
600 active frequencies and 2500 slownesses
and include the azimuthal components assoaiated with a moment tensor
point source.

<P>
A seismogram at a particular distance is produced by<BR>
a) an integration over slowness at each frequency with a distance 
   specific slowness factor<BR>
b) a Fast Fourier transform over frequency

<P>
The restriction on the number of slownesses in a single run to 2500
means that an integration over the full slowness range relevant to
all possible arrivals may often be best carried out using 2-4 separate
slowness integrations and then summing the seismogram traces at the same
distance to produce the final theoretical seismogram.  This procedure
also allows the sampling in slowness to be reduced for larger slowness
and so improve the accuracy of the integration.

<P>
The theoretical seismogram program erzs is used with a control file
which specifies the model file to be used and the parameters for
ray parameters and frequencies and multiples to be used in the calculation

<H3>Explanation of input parameters</H3>

<PRE>
Note all dimensions are in kilometres and times in seconds

1)  Title for Run
     Character string to be used as header for run

2)  File for T-X seismogram output
     Character string for name of file to receive T-X seismogram
     output in zst format

3)  Velocity model file:
     Character string for name of file with model specification
          the model file should be in the standard model file format
           (ndt = 0 for layer thickness specification)

4)  Surface Condition:
      The various boundary conditons to be applied at the surface are
      specified by mnemonics 
         A full calculation for a half space with 
            elastic free surface conditions              "HS"
         Calculation for a half space with only 
            first order surface reflections included     "H1"
         Calculation for a non-reflecting surface
            but with displacement corrected for 
            free surface amplification                   "WF"
         Calculation for a non-reflecting surface        "WS"

5)  Number of slownesses (<2500)
      Integer specifying the number of slownesses to be used.

      The slowness interval is divided into equal intervals to
      enable the integration over slowness to be performed
      Too coarse a slowness choice will give rise to inadequate
      sampling which usually gives oscillations in the seismograms
      at the highest frequency used.

6) Minimum slowness
      Lower edge of slowness band in s/km

7) Maximum slowness
      Upper edge of slowness band in s/km

    The theoretical seismograms for a single slowness panel will normally
    display numerical arrivals with the slownesses of the upper and lower
    limits of the window.  These can often be of significant amplitude.
    However, the adjacent panels will have comparable arrivals of opposite
    sign and on summation over the slowness panels the cancellation is 
    very successful.
  
    For land reflection work slowness bands of
      0.0001 - 0.30
      0.30   - 0.45
      0.45   - 0.60
      0.60   - 0.75
    will generally be sufficient to cover all arrivals

8) Slowness taper plo (n samples)
     Integer specifying the number of samples at the lower end of the
     slowness window over which the response is linearly tapered to
     zero

9) Slowness taper phi (n samples)
     Integer specifying the number of samples at the upper end of the
     slowness window over which the response is linearly tapered to
     zero

  If a several slowness panels are be added together then the number of
  samples should be set to zero - this will ensure the cancellation
  of numerical arrivals which have opposite sign on adjacent panels

10) Choice of source wavelet
      Specified time points    - "WA"
      Ricker wavelet           - "RI"

11) File for wavelet input 
     Character string for name of file for source wavelet input
     (needs to be specified even when "RI" option used)
 
12) Exponential damping
     Specification of exponential damping in time in construction 
     of seismograms ("YE" or "NO")

     If "YE" is specified the calculations are carried out in the 
     complex frequency domain with an effective exponential damping 
     applied in time. This improves the situation with aliasing in time
     and so shorter total time intervals can often be employed.
     However weak spatially aliased arrivals late in the record are
     magnified dramatically when exponential gain is applied to recover 
     the true time response.  As a result when exponential gain is used 
     only the first 3/4 of the time interval has gain recovery applied, 
     the remaining 1/4 should not be regarded as useful.

     If "NO" is specified then the calculations are all performed
     for real frequency and care needs to be taken to have the time
     interval of calculation long enough to avoid aliasing in time.

13) Number of time points
     Integer power of 2 e.g. 2048, specifying the total number of
     time points in the theoretical seismograms

14) Time step
     Sampling interval in time in seconds i.e. 4 ms sampling is 
     specified as 0.004

15) Frequency taper (low)
     A cosine taper in frequency is applied between the two
     specified frequencies e.g. for
       0.01  0.10
     Zero response is specified for frequencies less than 5 Hz and
     unit response for frequencies higher than 7 Hz with a cosine 
     taper between.

16) Frequency taper (high)
     A cosine taper in frequency is applied between the two
     specified frequencies e.g. for
       10.0  20.0
     Unit response is specified for frequencies less than 57 Hz and
     zero response for frequencies higher than 7 Hz with a cosine 
     taper between.

  Care should be taken that the number of discrete frequencies in the
  pass band of the band-pass filter does not exceed 600  - or array
  bound violations will occur with unpredictable results

17) Dominant Frequency for Ricker wavelet ["RI"]
     values of dominant ferequency to be used is "RI" wavelet selected
     (must be given even when "WA" option used)

18) Components of point moment tensor [x=N, y=E, z=D] in order
       Mxx, Mxy, Mxz
       Myx, Myy, Myz
       Mzx, Mzy, Mzz
     For an explosive pressure source specify
       MXX=MYY=MZZ= 1.0 ,  all others zero

19) Depth of source
     The depth of the source below the surface in km
     
     Note the program is built around a model of a point source
     (an array can be simulated in part by weighting dipole sources
      or by summing the response from different sources)

20) File for ranges and azimuths
     Character string for name of range and azimuth file 

22) Reduction slowness
     Value in s/km for the slowness to be used to adjust the time axis
     to follow spcific arrivals.  Valuable for refraction calculations
     but for reflection work set equal to 0.0

22) Start time (reduced)
     The beginning of the theoretical seismograms allowing for the
     reduction slowness.
     Use 0.00 to have the theoretical seismograms starting at the 
     source instant.

23) Debug/frequency-wavenumber ("YE" or "NO")

24) Debug/waveform             ("YE" or "NO")

  Setting either of these parameters to "YE" generates copious output
  and should not be necessary in normal use


Example of Wavelet file "ew.wav"
   Integer number of time points in specification of source waveform
   followed by discrete waveform values , e.g.,

   3                                   # of points in waveform /waveform
 100.0     0.00     0.00

     A complex time signature can be introduced here if desired but 
     it is just as easy to use a delta function source and then 
     convolve later with an appropriate source-time function

Example of range and azimuth file "ew.dst"
   Integer number of distances 
   followed by distances in km, azimuth in degrees

   10                                   #  of distances /distances
  2.00      45.00
  4.00      45.00
  6.00      45.00
  8.00      45.00
 10.00      45.00
 12.00      45.00
 14.00      45.00
 16.00      45.00
 18.00      45.00
 20.00      45.00
 22.00      45.00
