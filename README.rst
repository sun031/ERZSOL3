*******************************************************
Calculating the elastic response of a stratified medium
*******************************************************

The original code was written by Brian Kennett. I have slightly changed the code so that it can be compiled successfully. I also introduce some Python functions and scripts to run the ERZSOL3 more flexible and easier.

Changes
-------
1. Change line 136 of qbessel.f from

>>> COMPLEX FUNCTION BESHS0*16(X, IFAIL)

to

>>> COMPLEX FUNCTION BESHS0(X, IFAIL)

, so that the compilation could be successful.

2. Change the output seismogram from unformatted to text format.

3. Add some python scripts convert the wavefroms into SAC format.

sac.user1 :
